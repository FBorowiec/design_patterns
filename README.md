# Design Patterns

## Gamma Categorization

Design Patterns are typically split into three categories. This is called _Gamma Categorization_ after Erich Gamma, one of Gang of Four authors.

1. **Creational Patterns**:
   * Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
   * Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
   * Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)
2. **Structural Patterns**:
   * Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
   * Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
3. **Behavioral Patterns**:
   * They are all different - no central theme
